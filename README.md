# Overview

UNOTE! 



Hi! In the spirit of coding for fun more than learning. I tried creating something personal that we can be interested 
and passionate about. Nothing to serious and yet powerful enough to teach new skills. Remember for once how in the 80s 
and 90s, originated programmers. This project is for my own amusement touching for the first time graphics and the 
creation of images using C++. Not only that but animating a 2D image and make it look 3D.
